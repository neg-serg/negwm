#### [i3fyra]

prevent i3fyra_ws variable getting set when making
a tiled window floating with `--float`.

issue where moving tiled windows on the
i3fyra workspace that wasn't part of the layout
(ABCD), didn't work.

There where some issues recognising the i3fyra
workspace if the workspace had escaped double
quotes. When a new container (A|B|C|D) was created
by moving a window from an already existing
container. the new container was not marked and
placed correctly. 

#### [i3viswiz]

Corrected a typo that prevented focus switching
with floating windows to work properly.

got stuck and not working if there was no mark on
the rootcontainer.

#### [i3Kornhe]

Discovered that in rare cases a fifo could be left
from i3Kornhe when the i3session terminates. This
caused i3Kornhe to not work on the next start, and
this should be fixed now.

i3Kornhe bugfix patch applied. resizing tiled
windows should now work fine.
