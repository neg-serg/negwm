### v.0.1.65 - new stuff

Workspace name is added to the [i3list] output (i3list[WAN] and i3list[TAN]), these are used in i3run when a window is summoned. Summoning to a number created an new workspace if it had a name.  

`-t` flag added to [i3fyra]. It takes a string with options that are passed to i3list, making it possible to target other windows then the active one.

### v.0.1.65 - fixed stuff
Above mentioned thing with i3run and workspace names.  
[i3viswiz] focus function no works.
Negative splitsizes works when splits are manipulated in i3fyra outside the apllysplits function.
