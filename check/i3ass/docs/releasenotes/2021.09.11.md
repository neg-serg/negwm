#### [i3king]

Added support for **window_role** criteria.

Changed internal field separator to US (x1F).
This will fix issues related to window properties
containg the old field separator (`:`).

Fixed issue where windows whose target properties
contained a hyphen (`-`) wasn't recognized by 
GLOBAL or DEFAULT rules.

Sending USR1 to the i3king process will restart
i3king. Hint: `kill -USR1 $(< "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/i3ass/i3king.pid")`
