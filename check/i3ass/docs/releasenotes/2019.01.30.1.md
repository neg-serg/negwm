### 2019.01.30.2

Fixed two bugs (#46,#47) in [i3fyra] and [i3list].
`--hide` in [i3fyra] now works again. The issue in [i3list]
was affecting targeted windows and their floating state, 
resulting in unpredictable behavior when 
fi summoning a window from the scratchpad. 
All should be good now thanks to user **APotOfSoup**
who reported and found the solution to both these issues.
(the cause was the major refactoring and adaptation of the codebase to the `bashsbud` framework, introduced in the last release).
