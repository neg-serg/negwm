### 2019.02.19.3

Refactored the code for [i3get] to have a standalone `awk` file and also added better handling of regular expressions when they are passed as search strings to [i3get]. (*this might break some scripts that used esacped quotes and backslashes in the search strings*). You can now write a search like this: `i3get --instance '^sublime$` the "old" way of doing it would look something like this: `i3get -i "sublime\"\$"` and was more unreliable.  

[i3list] had one more of those small issues not reporting the correct screenheight in some cases, but it is now fixed.

All man pages had a typo that said "Linx manual" instead of "Linux manual" that is fixed now.
