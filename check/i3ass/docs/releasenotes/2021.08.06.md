### [i3king]

Added two new commandline options:  
`--apply` and `--no-restart`  
We now handle the restart signal from i3 IPC,
when that happens, all windows are matched against
the rules and i3king will automatically get restarted.

### [i3get]

added `y` as an argument for `--return`. It will
print the **window_type** of the current window.

### [i3fyra]

New commanline option `--conid`
