### [i3king]

Changed the resart behaviour. So i3king will now
try to restart whenever the IPC socket is broken,
which happens on f.i. i3 crashes.  

New commandline option: `--no-apply`, if set i3king
will not automatically try to apply rules when it
restarts.

This update was caught on tape, and can be seen at youtube:
