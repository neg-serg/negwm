#### bashbud

Many improvements to the build steps.
Manpages are included so no need for manpage generator
as dependency.

#### [i3list]
NEW KEY: `i3list[SUS]`  
contains the number of containers matching all criteria

#### [i3run]
When xdotool is used to rename a window class/instance
the window gets a new `container_id`, and now that
new id is reported instead of the old.

don't use eval when executing commands.
