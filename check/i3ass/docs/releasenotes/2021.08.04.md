### [i3king]

New script for managing window rules.

### [i3viswiz]

if the setting "focus_wrapping" is set
to "workspace" in the i3config. i3viswiz will
wrap the focus only inside the currenttly
focused workspace instead of the whole work
area (other monitors).

The setting has to be present in the active config
before the first i3viswiz invokation.

To force this behavior otherwise, issue the following
command:  
`i3var set focus_wrap workspace`

Or to disable it:  
`i3var set focus_wrap normal`


### [i3menu]

Fixed issue where empty STDIN got treated as a list.

### [i3run]

Only change since last version is to use
`i3fyra --force --array ARRAY` to override the
new virtual positions which are not needed with
i3run because it already figures out the correct
container.
