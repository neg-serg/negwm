### 2018.09.12.0

Added [focusvisible] and [getvisible].  
[i3get] now allows multiple search criterion and longoptions:  

```shell
i3get --class Thunar --instance thunar --ret wtf
```

The command above will print **w**orkspace, **t**itle and **f**loatstate of the first found window that have **both** the class *Thunar* and instance *thunar*.
