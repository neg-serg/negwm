Added [i3menu] which is an improved version of the script `oneliner` that has been available in the **budlabs organization** for some time. I figured i include it with **i3ass** instead, since it is very *i3 focused*, see the wiki for more info.  

Refactored [i3list] to make it easier to manage and fixed a small issue that resulted in splits being reported with the wrong size if the *main container* of the split was hidden. The issue had never caused any serious issues, but now that it is fixed I experience faster creation of the [i3fyra] layout, it also made some functions in the new script [i3menu] work as expected.
