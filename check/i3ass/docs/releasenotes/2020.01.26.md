### 2020.01.26.5

[i3menu]  
- added `sleep .05` before reading from STDIN. Hopefully fixes issue with list not getting populated.
- Added `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable default.

[i3run]
- added `--force` and `--FORCE` options. When enabled `command` will get executed even if the window exist.
