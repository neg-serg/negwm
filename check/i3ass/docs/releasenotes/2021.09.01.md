Corrected a typo in i3viswiz that prevented focus
switching with floating windows to work properly.

i3Kornhe bugfix patch applied. resizing tiled
windows should now work fine.

Fixes an issue that made i3viswiz to get stuck and
not working if there was no mark on the
rootcontainer.

Discovered that in rare cases a fifo could be left
from i3Kornhe when the i3session terminates. This
caused i3Kornhe to not work on the next start, and
this should be fixed now.

Fixes two issues related to i3fyra. There where
some issues recognising the i3fyra workspace if
the workspace had escaped double quotes. When a
new container (A|B|C|D) was created by moving a
window from an already existing container. the new
container was not marked and placed correctly. Its
fixed now.
