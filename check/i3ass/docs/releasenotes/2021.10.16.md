#### [i3zen]

Re-worked and re-added this script. It puts the
currently focused window in a floating, but tabbed
container on a *fresh* workspace. No ghostwindows,
works good with multiple workspaces. See the
[wiki](https://github.com/budlabs/i3ass/wiki/i3zen)
or manpage for more info.

#### [i3king]

Added `--winid` option.  
The new `window_icon_padding` property is now handled
so it works with the latest version of i3wm (4.20).

#### [i3run]

Fixed issues related to named workspaces always having
the same workspace number (-1) as the scratchpad.

Added `--verbose` option.

#### [i3list]

Multiple search criteria works well now. 

Added new keys:  

``` shell
i3list[APA] # Active Window parent ID
i3list[TPA] # Target Window parent ID
```
