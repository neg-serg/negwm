put TOP at the top of the list  

If TOP is set, the input stream (LIST) will get matched against TOP.
Lines in LIST with an exact MATCH of those in TOP will get moved to the TOP of LIST before the menu is created.

`$ printf '%s\n' one two three four | i3menu --top "$(printf '%s\n' two four)"`  

will result in a list looking like this:  
`two four one three`
