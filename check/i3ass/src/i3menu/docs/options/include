combination of p e l  

INCLUDESTRING can be set to force which elements of the menu to include.
INCLUDESTRING can be one or more of the following character:  

| char | element  |
|:-----|:---------|
|**p** | prompt   |
|**e** | entrybox |
|**l** | list     |

`echo "list" | i3menu --include le --prompt "enter a value: "`  
The command above will result in a menu without the **prompt** element.  

`i3menu --include pe --prompt "enter a value: "`  
The command above will result in a menu without a **list** element. (just an inputbox).  

It's also worth mentioning that **i3menu** adapts to the objects it knows before creating the menu. This means that if no input stream (list) exist, no list element will be included, the same goes for the prompt.
