Sets the "*anchor*" point of the menu.  

The default is **1**. **1** means the top left
corner, **9** means the bottom right corner.
Corner in this context doesn't refer to the
corners of the screen, but the corners of the
menu. If the anchor is *top left* (**1**), the
menu will *grow* from that point.
