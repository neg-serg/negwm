mouse, window, titlebar, tab, A, B, C, D  

This is where **i3menu** differs the most from normal **rofi** behavior and is the only option that truly depends on `i3`, `i3list` (and **i3fyra** if the value is A|B|C|D). If this option is not set, the menu will default to a single line (*dmenu like*) menu at the top of the screen. If however a value to this option is one of the following:  

- mouse       
  At the mouse position (requires `xdotool`)

- window      
  The currently active window.

- titlebar    
  The titlebar of the currently active window.

- tab         
  The tab (or titlebar if it isn't tabbed) of the currently active window.

- A,B,C or D  
  The **i3fyra** container of the same name if it is visible. If target container isn't visible the menu will be displayed at the default location.


titlebar and tab LAYOUT will be displayed as a single line (*dmenu like*) menu, and the other LAYOUTS will be of vertical (*combobox*) layout with the prompt and entrybox above the list.  

The position of the menu can be further manipulated by using `--xpos`,`--ypos`,`--width`,`--height`,`--orientation`,`--include`.  

`$ echo "list" | i3menu --prompt "select: " --layout window --xpos -50 --ypos 30`  
The command above would create a menu with the same size and position as the current window, but place it 50px to the left of the window, and 30px below the *lower* of the window.
