rename window properties on creation  

If the search criteria is `--instance`, the window
with instance: *OLDNAME* will get a new instance
name matching the criteria when it is created
(*needs `xdotool`*).

**NB**  
This option will not work reliably when using multiple
search criteria. When you want to do that instead use:  
`--rename-instance , --rename-class , --rename-title` .

```shell
i3run --instance budswin --rename sublime_main -- subl

# when the command above is executed:
# a window with the instance name: "budswin" will be searched for.
# if no window is found the command: "subl" will get executed,
# and when a window with the instance name: "sublime_main" is found,
# the instance name of that window will get renamed to: "budswin"

# the example below, will not work properly:  
i3run --title bud --instance budswin --rename sublime_main -- subl

# it will start like the first example, but if it
# doesnt find the custom instance budswin, it will
# try to search for a window with the TITLE sublime_main

# do this instead:  
i3run --title bud --instance budswin --rename-instance sublime_main -- subl
```
