update the size of the layout  

AB is point on the X axis, calculated from the
left side if INT is positive, from the right side
if it is negative. AC and BD is on Y axis from
the top if INT is positive, from the bottom if it
is negative. The whole argument needs to be
quoted. Example:  

`i3fyra --layout 'AB=-300 BD=420'

LAYOUT argument can also be the word 'redo', if it
is, the last layout appended will be restored.
