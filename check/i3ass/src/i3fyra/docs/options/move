move window/create container  

DEST can either be the name of a container
(A|B|C|D), or it's position relative to the
current container with a direction:[`l`|`left`]
[`r`|`right`][`u`|`up`][`d`|`down`] If the
container doesnt exist it is created. If argument
is a direction and there is no container in that
direction, Connected container(s) visibility is
toggled. If current window is floating or not
inside ABCD, normal movement is performed.
Distance for moving floating windows with this
action can be defined with the `--speed` option.
Example: `$ i3fyra --speed 30 -m r` Will move
current window 30 pixels to the right, if it is
floating.
